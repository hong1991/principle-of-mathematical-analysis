Given a [[sequence]] $(p_n)$, consider a sequence $(n_k)$ of positive integers such that $n_1<n_2<n_3<\cdots$. Then the sequence $(p_{n_i})$ is called a **subsequence** of $(p_n)$. If $(p_{n_i})$ converges, its limit is called it **subsequential limit** of $(p_n)$.

It is clear that $(p_n)$ converges to $p$ if and only if every subsequence of $(p_n)$ converges to $p$.
