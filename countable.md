For any positive integer $n$, let $J_n$ be the set whose elements are the integers $1, 2, ...,n$; let $J$ be the set consisting of all positive integers. For any set $A$, we say:
1. $A$ is **finite** if $A\sim J_n$ for some $n$ (the empty set is also considered to be finite).
2. $A$ is **infinite** if $A$ is not finite.
3. $A$ is **countable** if $A\sim J$.
4. $A$ is **uncountable** if $A$ is neither finite nor countable.
5. $A$ is **at most countable** if $A$ is finite or countable.
Countable sets are somethimes called **enumerable**, or **denumerable**.

For two finite sets $A$ and $B$, we evidently have $A\sim B$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ contains the same number of elements. For inifinite sets, however, the idea of "having the same number of elements" becomes quite vague, whereas the notation of [[equivalence relation|1-1 correspondence]] retains its clarity.

**Remark**
A finite set cannot be equivalent to one of its proper subsets. That this is, however, possible for inifinite set.
