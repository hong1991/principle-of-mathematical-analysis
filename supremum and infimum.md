Suppose $S$ is an [[ordered set]], $E\subset S$, and $E$ is [[bounded]] above. Suppose there exists an $\alpha\in S$ with the following properties:
1. $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $E$.
2. If $\gamma\lt\alpha$ then $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $E$.
Then $\alpha$ is called the **least upper bound** of $E$ (that there is at most one such $alpha$ is clear from 2) or the **supremum** of $E$, and we write $$\alpha=\sup E.$$
The **greatest lower bound**, or **infimum**, of a set $E$ which is bounded below is defined in the same manner: The statement $$\alpha=\inf E$$means that $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ and that no $\beta$ with $\beta\gt\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$.
