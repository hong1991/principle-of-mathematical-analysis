1. If $x\in R$, $y\in R$, and $x>0$, then there is a positive integer $n$ such that $nx>y$.
2. If $x\in R$, $y\in R$, and $x<y$, then there exists a $p\in Q$ such that $x<p<y$.

**Proof 1:**
Let $A$ be the set of all $nx$, where $n$ runs through the positive integers. If 1 were false, then $y$ would be an [[bounded|upper bound]] of $A$. But then $A$ has a [[supremum and infimum|least upper bound]] in $R$([[real field|*]]). Put $\alpha=\sup A$. Since $x>0$, $\alpha-x<\alpha$, and$\alpha-x$ is not an upper bound of $A$. Hence $\alpha-x<mx$ for some positive integer $m$. But then $\alpha<(m+1)x\in A$, which is impossible, since $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $A$.

**Proof 2:**
