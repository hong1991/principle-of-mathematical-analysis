By the **segment** $(a,b)$ we mean the set of all [[real field|real numbers]] $x$ such that $a<x<b$.
By the **interval** $[a,b]$ we mean the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $a\le x\le b$.
Occasionally we shall also encounter "half-open intervals" $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$; the first consists of all $x$ such that $a\le x\lt b$, the second of all $x$ such that $a\lt x \le b$.

If $a_i<b_i$ for $i=1,...,k$, the set of all points $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,...,x_k)$ in $R^k$([[Euclidean space|*]]) whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities $a_i\le x_i\le b_i$ $(1\le i\le k)$ is called a **$k$-cell**. Thus a $1$-cell is an interval, a $2$-cell is a rectangle, etc.
