Consider two sets $A$ and $B$, whose elements may be any objects whatsoever, and suppose that with each element $x$ of $A$ there is associated, in some manner, an element of $B$, chich we denote by $f(x)$. 
Then $f$ is said tobe a **function** from $A$ to $B$ (or a **mapping** of $A$ into $B$). 
The set $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$ (we also say $f$ is defined on $A$), and the elements $f(x)$ are called the **values** of $f$. 
The set of all values of $f$ is called the **range** of $f$.
If $E\subset A$, $f(E)$ is defined to be the set of all elements $f(x)$, for $x\in E$. We call $f(E)$ the **image** of $E$ under $f$. In this notation, $f(A)$ is the range of $f$.
It is clear that $f(A)\subset B$. If $f(A)=B$, we say that $f$ maps $A$ **onto** $B$. (Note that, according to this usage, **onto** is more specific than **into**.)
If $E\subset B$, $f^{-1}(E)$ denotes the set of all $x\in A$ such that $f(x)\in E$. We call $f^{-1}(E)$ the **inverse image** of $E$ under $f$. 
If $y\in B$, $f^{-1}(y)$ is the set of all $x\in A$ such that $f(x)=y$. If, for each $y\in B$, $f^{-1}(y)$ consists of at most one element of $A$, then $f$ said to be 1-1 (**one-to-one**) mapping of $A$ into $B$. This may also be expressed as folows: $f$ is a 1-1 mapping of $A$ into $B$ provided that $f(x_1)\ne f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1\ne x_2$, $x_1\in A$, $x_2\in A$.
