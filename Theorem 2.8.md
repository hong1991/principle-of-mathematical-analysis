Every inifinite subset of a [[countable]] set $A$ is countable.
**Proof:** Suppose $E\subset A$, and $E$ is inifinite. Arrange the elements $x$ of $A$ in a sequence $(x_n)$ of distinct elements. Construct a sequence $\{n_k\}$ as follows:
Let $n_1$ be the smallest positive integer such that $x_{n_1}\in E$. Having chosen $n_1,...,n_{k-1}$ ($k=2,3,4,...), let $n_k$ be the smallest integer greater than $n_{k-1}$ such that $x_{n_k}\in E$.
Putting $f(k)=x_{n_k}$ ($k=1,2,3,...$), we obtain a [[equivalence relation|1-1 correspondence]] between $E$ and $\mathbb{N}$.

The theorem shows that, roughly speaking, countable sets represent the "smallest" infinity: No uncountable set can be a subset of a countable set.
