For each positive integer $k$, let $R^k$ be the set of all ordered $k$-tuples $$\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,...,x_k),$$where $x_1,...,x_k$ are [[real field|real numbers]], called the **coordinates** of $\mathbf{x}$. The elements of $R^k$ are called points, or vectors, especially when $k>1$. We shall denote vectors by boldfaced letters. If $\mathbf{y}=(y_1,...,y_k)$ and if $\alpha$ is a real number, put $$\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}=(x_1+y_1,...,x_k+y_k)$$$$\alpha\mathbf{x}=(\alpha x_1,...,\alpha x_n)$$
so that $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}\in R^k$ and $\alpha\mathbf{x}\in R^k$. This defines addition of vectors, as wellas multiplication of a vector by a real number (a scalar). These two operations satisfy the commutative, associative, and distributive laws (the proof is trivial, in view of the analogous laws for real numbers) and make $R^k$ into a **vector space over the real field**. The zero elements of $R^k$ (sometimes called the **origin** of the **null vector**) is the point $\mathbf{0}$, all of those coordinates are $0$.

We also define the so-called "inner product" (or scalar product) of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ by $$\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{y}=\sum_{i=1}^k x_iy_i$$and the **norm** of $\mathbf{x}$ by $$|\mathbf{x}|=(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{x})^{1/2}=(\sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2)^{1/2}.$$
The structure now defined (the vector space $R^k$ with the above inner product and norm is called euclidean $k$-space).
