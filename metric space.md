A set $X$, whose elements we shall call **points**, is said to be a **metric space** if with any two points $p$ and $q$ of $X$ there is associated a [[real field|real number]] $d(p,q)$, called the **distance** from $p$ to $q$, such that
1. $d(p,q)>0$ if $p\ne q$; $d(p,p)=0$;
2. $d(p,q)=d(q,p)$;
3. $d(p,q)\le d(p,r)+d(r,q)$ for any $r\in X$.
Any [[function]] with these three properties is called a **distance function**, or a **metric**.
