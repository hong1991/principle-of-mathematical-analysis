A [[sequence]] $(p_n)$ in a [[metric space]] $X$ is said to **converge** if there is a point $p\in X$ with the following proerty: For every $\epsilon>0$ there is an integer $\mathbb{N}$ such that $n\ge\mathbb{N}$ implies that $d(p_n,p)<\epsilon$.
In this case, we also say that $(p_n)$ converges to $p$, or that $p$ is the limit of $(p_n)$, and we write $p_n\to p$, or $$\lim_{n\to\infty}p_n=p.$$If $(p_n)$ does not converge, it is said to **diverge**.

The sequence $(p_n)$ is said to be **bounded** if its [[function|range]] is [[elements and subsets of metric space|bounded]].
