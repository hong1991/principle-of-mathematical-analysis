If there exists a [[function|1-1 mapping]] of $A$ onto $B$, we say that $A$ and $B$ can be put in 1-1 **correspondence**, or that $A$ and $B$ have the same **cardinal number**, or, briefly, that $A$ and $B$ are quivalend, and we write $A \sim B$. This rleation clearly has the following properties:
+ It is reflexive: $A\sim A$.
+ It is symmetric: If $A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$.
+ It is transitive: If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$.
Any relation with these three properties is called an **equivalence relation**.
