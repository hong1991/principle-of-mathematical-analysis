Given a [[sequence]] $(a_n)$, we use the notation $$\sum_{n=p}^q a_n\qquad(p\le q)$$to denote the sum $a_p+a_{p+1}+\cdots+a_q$. With $(a_n)$, we associate a sequence $(s_n)$, where $$s_n=\sum_{k=1}^n a_k.$$For $(s_n)$ we also use the symbolic expression $$a_1+a_2+a_3+\cdots$$or, more concisely, $$(1)\qquad\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n.$$The symbol (1) we call an **infinite series** or just a **series**. The numbers $s_n$ are called the **partial sums** of the series. If $(s_n)$ [[convergent sequence|converges]] to $s$, we say that the series **converges**, and write $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n=s.$$The number s is called the sum of the series; but it should be clearly understood that $s$ is the **limit of a sequence of sums**, and is not obtained simply by addition.
If $(s_n)$ diverges, the series is said to diverge.
