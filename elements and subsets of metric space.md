Let $X$ be a [[metric space]]. All points and sets mentiond below are understood to be elements and subsets of $X$.
1. A **neighborhood** of $p$ is a set $N_r(p)$ consisting of all $q$ such that $d(p,q)<r$ for some $r>0$. The number $r$ is called the **radius** of $N_r(p)$.
2. A point $p$ is a **limit point** of the set $E$ if every neighborhood of $p$ contains a point $q\ne p$ such that $q\in E$.
3. If $p\in E$ and $p$ is not a limit point of $E$, then $p$ is called an **isolated point** of $E$.
4. $E$ is **closed** if every limit point of $E$ is a point of $E$.
5. A point $p$ is an **interior** point of $E$ if there is a neighborhood $N$ of $p$ such that $N\subset E$.
6. $E$ is **open** if every point of $E$ is an interior point of $E$.
7. The **complement** of $E$ (denoted by $E^c$) is the set of all points $p\in X$ such that $p\notin E$.
8. $E$ is **perfect** if $E$ is closed and if every point of $E$ is a limit point of $E$.
9. $E$ is **bounded** if there is a [[real field|real number]] $M$ and a point $q\in X$ such that $d(p,q)<M$ for all $p\in E$.
10. $E$ is **dense** in $X$ if every point of $X$ is a limit point of $E$, or a point of $E$ (or both).

Let us note that $R^1$ neighborhoods are [[segment, interval and k-cell|segments]], whereas $R^2$ neighborhoods are interiors of circles.
