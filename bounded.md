Suppose $S$ is an [[ordered set]], and $E\subset S$. If there exists a $\beta\in S$ such that $x\le\beta$ for every $x\in E$, we say that $E$ is **bounded above**, and call $\beta$ an **upper bound** of $E$.
**Lower bounds** are defined in the same way.

Bounded for a [[metric space]] is defined in [[elements and subsets of metric space]].
